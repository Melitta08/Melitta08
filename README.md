# About me ðŸŒ»




Iâ€™m currently working as an IT Service Desk Agent at TCS Hungary. 

I'm also a practicing artist with painting as my main interest. I have an ongoing exhibition in my hometown showcasing my work from the last few years. ðŸŒž

I registered to GitHub to learn primarly about Data Science and to build a portfolio.
